This file is an reminder to self
The plan is to some how intergrate c++ into my TESA Project
If I could execute code such as c++ files with ***Kotlin code*** i believe that'll be nice (or vice versa)
So Technically I could make the TESA Project writen (controled) by C++ witch will act almost very much like automaion.
For example: I have c++ compile pre written Kotlin code whitch will have there own functionallity.
